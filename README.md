# Doodle

## How to Start

The webapp can be accessed via `https://cs-279r-doodle.herokuapp.com/`

## How to Use

Type in a desired username into the login page and press enter to submit. You will be redirected to a calendar page with timeslots to choose from.

Click on the star or the name of the timeslot to toggle availability (Yellow text indicates available, white text indicates unavailable).

Click submit once you're done with filling out availabilities.

You can access the calendar page in read-only mode after you submit availabilities via entering your username in the login page or by going to `https://cs-279r-doodle.herokuapp.com/user/<your username>`
